# Text-Info

This package contains modules to retrieve information from TEI corpora.

It also contains modules to work with XML schemas, to validate XML against schemas,
to determine which elements are mixed and which are pure, etc.
For these operations you need to have Java installed.

The development of the programs here is driven by the need of
[KNAW/HuC](https://di.huc.knaw.nl/text-analysis-en.html)
to publish its textual corpora in the way of texts plus web annotations.
